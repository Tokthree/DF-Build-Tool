### Blurb over

Real talk, this is a project I've wanted to work on for a long time. However, I have always been lacking the necessary skills to make it happen. First and foremost: This project is for myself, to say that I can do it; if anyone else finds it useful, then hot dang I simply cannot stop winning.

  - Color coded if you're above, below or equal to the points granted by your entered level!
